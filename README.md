Adaptive Headlight System Source Code

About AHS:
During night drives, when an opposite vehicle arrives, both the drivers are obliged to dim their corresponding light. The highest fatal traffic accident rate occurs on curved roads at night time. There comes the importance of the role of automobile forward lighting systems.
In order to provide enhanced night time safety measures, this work aims to design and build a prototype of steerable headlights that automatically dims the headlamps of vehicles, when an opposite vehicle arrives using ATmega328P.
